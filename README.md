# RTL-Design-and-Synthesis-using-sky130


## Day 1: Introduction to Verilog, Simulation, and Synthesis

On the first day of the workshop, we were introduced to the fundamentals of Verilog for RTL (Register Transfer Level) design, along with the tools necessary for simulation and synthesis of digital logic circuits.

---

## Tools Introduced

### 1. **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**
- Open-source Verilog simulation and compilation tool.
- Used to compile Verilog design files and generate simulation results.

### 2. **GTKWave**
- Waveform viewer for displaying signal changes over time from simulation output.
- Used to analyze `.vcd` (Value Change Dump) files generated by simulations.

### 3. **Yosys**
- Open-source framework for Verilog synthesis.
- Converts RTL designs into gate-level netlists.

##Installation Commands (macOS – using Homebrew)

```bash
brew install iverilog
brew install gtkwave
brew install yosys
